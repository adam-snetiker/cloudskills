# CloudSkills

This is a repository for all of my projects from CloudSkills.io bootcamps. So far, current and future courses include Cloud Native DevOps, AWS Architecture, Web Development in the Cloud, and Azure Administrator.

Each branch represents a different course. This file includes a list of all projects I'm working on, and it will be updated every week to reflect new topics I'm learning.

**Week 1: DevOps Fundamental Skills**
- Getting Started with GitHub
- Setting up Your First Azure Environment
- Setting up Your first AWS Environment
- Setting up Projects in GitHub

**Week 2: Scripting Like a Developer**
- Setting up a Dev Environment from Start to Finish
- Reusable and Clean Python Code
- Reusable and Clean PowerShell Code
- Linting in PowerShell and Python
- Testing in PowerShell and Python
